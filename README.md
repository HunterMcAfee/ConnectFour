# Project_1_ConnectFour
## Overview

The game I built for Project 1 was Connect Four.

When the player arrives at the site, they will see the title along with a how to play section on the rules and functionality.  Whenever one of the players presses a drop button, it will populate that respective column with that player's game piece (ex. red or black).  Once a player achieves four game pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), the page will display dialogue for the player that one.  The game comes with a scoreboard that keeps track of each player's win count.  There is an indicator that displays the current players turn.  Lastly, there is a button that will reset the game board so it can be played again.
